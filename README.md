A simple, yet lightweight, fast elliptical curve cryptography library in kotlin.

## Supported Curves
This library comes with a plethora of curves, but do not worry! You can create your own curve to fit your cryptographic needs. Below are listed the curves that come out of the box. 

* `Secp256k1`

## Hashing
This library comes with some hashing algorithms to create signatures, you can implement your own if your favorite hashing algorithm is not included. Below are listed the hashing algorithms that come out of the box. 

* `SHA256`
